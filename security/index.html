                                This report outlines the vulnerabilities to security in the "Marauder's Map". This web app was developed by Kyle Slinger for Assignment 2 and Assignment 3 in Tufts' Web Programming course. The Marauder's Map is web application that tracks the location of the users that log into the system. This application has a front-end that displays the locations of its users using Google Maps. The information from this app can also be accessed through a plaintext site.
                        </p>
                        <p class="element_text">
                                The site is currently vulnerable to multiple forms of disruption that would reduce the usability for users. Throughout this report, the issues will be documented and remedies will be proposed.
                        </p>

                        <p class="bullet">Methodology</p>

                        <p class="element_text">
                                The web app was tested in two significant ways. The first tests were performed on a "black-box". This technique is similar to how an attacker might try to disrupt the website. During the black-box tests, I did not look at the code and simply attempted multiple attacks. The following tests were performed after looking at the code to find logical errors or more specific vulnerabilities.
                        </p>

                        <p class="bullet">Abstract of Findings</p>

                        <p class="element_text">

                                This website is not particularly secure. The application can be hacked in multiple ways by giving the system malicious input. During black-box testing, the site was broken in 3 ways. The site lets an attacker break the UI through script injection and interrupt the UI by changing the DOM. Furthermore, the DB can be easily slowed down by sending repeating curl commands from multiple sources. Lastly, after pushing approximately 180 MB of text into the database, the site refused to load. All of these issues stem from the way in which the database stores information. As of yet, no security issues have been found with the Google Maps front end, perhaps because that code has been tested by a massively significant audience.

                                The security vulnerabilities in this implementation of the Marauder's Map make the web app easily broken and manipulated. If Kyle Slinger follows the recomendations given in this report, the site will be much less vulnerable to basic attacks. However, there will presumably still be issues that require further research and work to fix.
