I believe all aspects of the work have been implemented correctly, I 
experimented a little with css on top of the required work. Specifically, 
I was wondering how you would add classes to each element (content and username)
so you could put them on different lines.

I spent about 4 hours on the assignment.


Browsers have implemented a same-origin policy that make sure javascript
only accesses data from the same origin. Same origin means that the URLs
have the same protocol, host, and port. Therefore, my implementation of 
accessing data would not and does not work unless I disable web security.
Disabling websecurity lets the browser run javascript such that it can 
request data from other origins.
