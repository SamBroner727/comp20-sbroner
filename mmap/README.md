Assignment 2


This assignment took about 4 hours to complete.

I believe everything has been implemented correctly. I actually wrote this
code while on a bus home and I used my phone as a hotspot. While this was 
a great experience, I couldn't rigorously check my Haversine formula results.
Besides this, I feel very confident!
